# Logistic Regression for Diabetes Prediction

**Description:**

This Python code implements a Logistic Regression model from scratch to predict diabetes diagnoses based on various patient characteristics. It uses the `Healthcare-Diabetes.csv` dataset (assumed to be located in the same directory).

**Features:**

- Data pre-processing
- Logistic Regression model implementation
- Model training and prediction

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

**Usage:**

1. **Download the `Healthcare-Diabetes.csv` dataset:** Ensure it's in the same directory as this code.
2. **Run the script:** Execute the Python script (e.g., `python diabetes_prediction.py`).

**Customization:**

- Modify the `LogisticRegression` class for hyperparameter tuning.
- Explore feature engineering techniques.
- Add functionalities like model saving and visualization.
